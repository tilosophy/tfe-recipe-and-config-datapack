# tfe-recipe-and-config-datapack
This datapack handles all new and adjusted recipes, as well as general config settings for the modpack "The Final Exploration".

This datapack currently contains the following pre-existing datapacks:

- Create Man of Many Planes Recipe Datapack v1.0
- Create Immersive Aircrafts Datapack 1.20.1 - 1.2
- Create Immersive Aircrafts Warship Recipe DataPack

All recipes from the "Create: Sifter" mod have been disabled by this datapack, as they were deemed too strong for the early game.
Custom recipes for the device are being worked on in a separate project.
